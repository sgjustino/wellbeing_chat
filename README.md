# An MVP Project to Integrate a Wellbeing Chatbot with a Conversation Analysis LLM for Counselling Insights

This project showcases a proof-of-concept where two LLMs work together: Averie, a friendly wellbeing chatbot, assists users by providing supportive conversations, while Cora, a separate LLM, analyzes the conversations to identify potential issues, likely causes, and suggest follow-up queries to improve the interactions. Both LLMs are based on the LLaMA 3 7B model via the Groq.com API.
